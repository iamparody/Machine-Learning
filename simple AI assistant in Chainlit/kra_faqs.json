To ensure compliance with the 6-month rule as outlined in Section 17 of the VAT Act, 2013, the system searches through a series of the sellers’ VAT returns before qualifying inconsistencies.\nIf any inconsistencies are noted between the buyer and sellers’ declarations, the system generates a detailed inconsistency report and sends a copy to both the buyer’s and the seller’s emails as provided in iTax.\nIn such event, the buyer and/or the seller are expected to amend the respective VAT returns to reflect the true position of the supply invoice (PIN, Invoice number, date and amount) in their VAT returns within a stated period.\nUpon the lapse of the period, another report will be generated based on the amended returns. An email with a report of outstanding inconsistencies will then be sent to both the buyer and seller.\nAny inconsistencies must thereafter be addressed within given timelines failure to which unresolved VAT inputs will be disallowed."

Supplier/purchaser PIN,iv. Transaction amount\nThere are 2 indicators of an inconsistency:\na. Under-declaration (denoted as ‘UD’ in the inconsistency report) – The seller has declared an amount lower than that declared by the corresponding buyerb. Non-declaration (denoted as ‘ND’ in the inconsistency report) – The corresponding seller has not declared the sale in their VAT return When the seller has not provided invoice details as prescribed in the VAT return but has captured sales made to VAT registered taxpayers as a lumped figure under the field ‘sales made to taxpayers not registered for VAT’, the system will register this as ND. This field, found in the last field of Sheet B in the VAT return is strictly used to capture sales made to the end consumer who is not registered for VAT. It should therefore not be used for sales made to VAT registered taxpayers who may end up claiming the amount as VAT input in their returns."

The seller should appreciate that all sales made to VAT registered taxpayers will need to be claimed in VAT returns of respective buyers. Therefore there is need for both parties to minimize unnecessary amendment of returns by reflecting accurate invoice details in the VAT returns."

The respective supplier/purchaser may have declared different details that may be incorrect and they therefore need to declare the correct details.

In instances where an amendment affects any purchase invoice entries whose invoice date is older than 6 months and 20 days, the system considers such to be time barred and will not validate the return. Upon such amendment, taxpayers are advised to:\n \n\nPrepare and save a copy of the amended return and visit the nearest KRA Tax Service Office or Support Centre for assistance in uploading the same on iTax."

Where gaps are identified, leading to tax liability, the taxpayer is informed both orally and in writing and is requested to respond to the issues before an assessment or demand is issued.  Thereafter the taxpayer is informed of his or her right to object to the demand or assessment.\nThe taxpayer has the option of paying the taxes or objecting to the demand or assessment and appealing to the Tax Appeals Tribunal."

The person seeking to be declared bankrupt must inform its creditors of the bankruptcy proceedings. The legal team would ensure that the KRA is listed as a creditor during the bankruptcy proceedings and further ensure that the tax owed is listed in priority to other creditors.\nWe have not had cases where a taxpayer moves to be declared bankrupt following a court case. However we have had instances of company’s being dissolved and for that we have the Insolvency Act to guide us."

            "answer": "We have a number of strategies:\n\nThe lawyers work hand in hand with the tax auditors who raise assessments to ensure that they are aligned on the issues being addressed. In KRA cases we have witnesses who are tax experts testifying in the cases and this ensures that technical questions are given first hand answers to the Tribunal or judge.\nAll cases are evaluated by a Technical Evaluation Committee that ensures the KRA case is airtight if the case is to be litigated. If the case is weak the committee recommends settlement of the case by KRA. This ensures we only litigate strong cases that are likely to result in revenue collection.\nWithin the litigation division, cases are handled by teams of lawyers as opposed by an individual counsel. This ensures objectivity, creativity, and support in the litigation process.\nKRA lawyers go on trainings from time to time to build capacity as both technical tax lawyers and in trial advocacy.\nKRA is a member of the Court users Committee which is a forum bringing together litigants to deliberate on the best ways to fast track the hearing and determination of cases."

            "question": "What is the Inclusive Framework?",
            "answer": "In 2015, OECD and G20 set up an international framework, dubbed the OECD/G20 BEPS Project (the Inclusive Framework), to combat tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs) using base erosion and profit shifting tools.  The aim of the project is to mitigate tax loopholes so that corporations cannot shift profits from a country with a high corporate tax rate to countries with a low tax rate.  \nThe project is now in its implementation phase, 141 countries and jurisdictions are involved including a majority of developing countries. Kenya joined the Inclusive Framework in 2017 and has been an active participant since.  Participating countries of the project set up 15 Action Plans (The BEPS action plan) to tackle tax avoidance, improve the coherence of international tax rules and ensure a more transparent tax environment.\nBase Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) refers to tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to locations with no/low tax rates and no/little economic activity.  This results in little or no corporate tax being paid, as well as annual revenue losses for governments. OECD estimates that globally, governments lose at least 100 – 240 billion USD, equivalent to 4 – 10% of global corporate income tax revenue.\nImplementation of the 15 Actions of the BEPS package is underway. Action 1 of the BEPS package addresses the digital economy.  Participating members of the project have been working on consensus-based, long-term solutions to the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. The consultations resulted in the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalization of the Economy that was published on 8th October 2021.\nThe deal offers a common approach to taxation of the digital economy globally. Interested countries and jurisdictions can participate by joining the Statement. In terms of consensus, 137 out of the 141 OECD IF countries and jurisdictions have joined the Statement."

            "question": "What is the Two-Pillar Approach?",
            "answer": "Pillar One aims to ensure a fairer distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest MNEs, which are the winners of globalization. It seeks to tax the largest MNEs (those with at least 20 billion euros in revenue) and the most profitable (profit before tax of 100) where 25% of the residual profit above the 10% is re-allocated to market jurisdictions.\nPillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases. It seeks to strengthen tax avoidance and harmful tax practices.\n\n\n\n\nKEY ELEMENTS OF THE TWO-PILLAR SOLUTION\n\n\n\n\nPillar One\n\n\nPillar Two\n\n\n\n\nTaxing rights on 25% of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs. This  would be re-allocated to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located\n\n\nA global minimum tax of 15% on all MNEs with annual revenue over 750 million euros\n\n\n\n\nTax certainty through mandatory and binding dispute resolution, with an elective regime to accommodate certain low-capacity countries\n\n\nRequirement for all jurisdictions that apply a nominal corporate income tax rate below 9% to interest, royalties, and a defined set of other payments to implement the “Subject to Tax Rule” into their bilateral treaties with developing Inclusive Framework members when requested to, so that their tax treaties cannot be abused.\n\n\n\n\nRemoval and standstill of Digital Services Taxes and other relevant, similar measures upon joining the Two Pillar approach\n\n\n\n\nThe establishment of a simplified and streamlined approach to the application of the arm’s length principle in specific circumstances, with a particular focus on the needs of low-capacity countries.\n\n\nCarve-out to accommodate tax incentives for substantial business activities"
